          Ingredients 2-3 large eggs Salt, to taste Pepper, to taste 1

          Instructions Beat the eggs: In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of
          salt and pepper until they are well mixed. You can add a tablespoon of
          water or milk for a fluffier texture. Heat the pan: Place a non-stick
          frying pan over medium heat and add butter or oil. Cook the omelette:
          Once the butter is melted and bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the pan
          to ensure the eggs evenly coat the surface. Add fillings (optional):
          When the eggs begin to set at the edges but are still slightly runny
          in the middle, sprinkle your chosen fillings over one half of the
          omelette. Fold and serve: As the omelette continues to cook, carefully
          lift one edge and fold it over the fillings. Let it cook for another
          minute, then slide it onto a plate. Enjoy: Serve hot, with additional
          salt and pepper if needed.
